# RoundAboutTesting
A testbed for the actual round/actor/effect tracking for RoundAbout. Made for Eclipse. Android UI can be hooked up later.

If this isn't done by the time I'm out of UTSA, I'll refactor it to work with IntelliJ, because... that's what I prefer working with now. But this should be done by then. (TIMESTAMP 8/30/2017 because I want to humiliate myself later when this isn't done.)
